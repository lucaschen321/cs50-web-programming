      <h3>I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day (1863)</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Based on: Micah 5:5</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        On a chilly Christmas morning in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1863 the bells rang loud and
        clear, announcing the birth of the Christ child. The sound of carols filled the air as
        children played in the streets. But hunched over on his desk, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
        took up his pen and began to write.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1861, 2 years earlier, Longfellow had lost his wife Frances in a fire. Then in 1863,
        amidst the American Civil War, his eldest son Charles resolved to fight for the Union
        without his father's blessing. Citing duty to his country, Charles enlisted, but returned
        after being severely wounded in the campaign.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was on this Christmas that Longfellow wrote
        <i>I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day</i> as he sought to capture the dissonance between
        what he felt in his heart and what he observed around him. The cheer of the holiday season
        stood in bleak constrast to the enveloping darkness he felt in his own life.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        And in despair I bowed my head; "There is no peace on earth," I said; "For hate is strong,
        And mocks the song Of peace on earth, good-will to men!"
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Often times, the injustice and darkness in the world seem to taunt the hope that lives
        within us. The feel-good songs in worship seem to blithely overlook and perhaps even mock
        the deep-seated hurt that one may feel. How could the Lord require a shout of joy or a song
        of praise from someone in deep anguish.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>
          Our captors required of us songs, and our tormentors, mirth, saying, “Sing us one of the
          songs of Zion!” How shall we sing the Lord's song in a foreign land? (Ps 137:2-3, cf. Ps
          22:7-8)
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>
        But we must not forget Calvary, because it was there that our Lord bore all the shame and
        scoffing that the world could give. Indeed, the way of the cross can seem like folly (1 Cor
        1:31), but it was in and through man's darkest hour, that God miraculously brought
        redemption and salvation for all humanity. In the same way, God invites us to listen to him,
        trusting that He is at work and in control, even when we can't see it (2 Cor 5:7).
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: "God is not dead, nor doth He sleep; The Wrong
        shall fail, The Right prevail, With peace on earth, good-will to men."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Let us then press on toward the goal (Phi 3:14), for even the darkest season is but a
        fleeting shadow compared to the eternal weight of glory that awaits us (2 Cor 4:17).
